testdev, the first learning project
=======

This repository will include diverse scripts I've built with (most likely) or without help.
The first project that got me going is an interactive story(IAS). I imagined a lot of if-else statements, but so far there's been a lot of setbacks. I can feel the if's coming. Luckily, I have been enjoying the setbacks, so I suppose they're more like set-forths, and they have been educational. Anyway, my end goal is to build an IAS with a combat system (perhaps a bit(A BIT) like the DnD system), branching story choices (main feature(expected to be timeconsuming)), and an inventory and item system(haven't gotten around to planning this, but it's low-priority).
This all means that the first script pieces will attempt to further either my knowledge of python, the IAS itself, or both.
