testdev, the first learning project\n
=======\n
\n
This repository will include diverse scripts I've built.
The first project that got me going is an interactive story(IAS). My immediate goal is building proficiency with the various types of data-handling a programming language offers. My end goal is to build an IAS with a functioning combat system, branching story choices (main feature), and an inventory and item system.\n
This all means that the first script pieces will attempt to further either: my knowledge of python, the IAS itself, or both.
