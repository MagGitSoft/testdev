testdev, the first learning project
=======

This repository will include diverse scripts I've built with (most likely) or without help.
The first project that got me going is an interactive story(IAS). I imagined a lot of if-else statements, but so far there's been a lot of setbacks. The if's coming... Luckily, the setbacks have been enjoyable, so I suppose they're more like set-forths, and they have been educational. Anyway, my end goal is to build an IAS with a functioning combat system , branching story choices (main feature), and an inventory and item system.
This all means that the first script pieces will attempt to further either: my knowledge of python, the IAS itself, or both.
