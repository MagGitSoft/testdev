testdev, the first learning project
=======

This repository will include diverse scripts I've built with (most likely(or without)) help.
The first project that got me going is an interactive story(IAS) type. I imagined a lot of if-else statements, so far there's been a lot of setbacks. Luckily, I have been enjoying them. Anyway, my end goal is to build an IAS with a combat system (perhaps a bit(A BIT) like the DnD system), branching story choices (main feature(expected to be timeconsuming)), and an inventory and item system(haven't gotten around to planning this, but it's low-priority).
This all means that the first script pieces will attempt to further either my knowledge of python, the IAS itself, or both.
